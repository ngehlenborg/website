It features a graphical user interface and supports the development and integration of existing and new analysis methods. Besides the infrastructural core functionality, Mayday offers a variety of plug-ins, such as various interactive viewers, a connection to the R statistical environment, a connection to SQL-based databases and different data mining methods, including WEKA-library based methods for classification and various clustering methods. In addition, so-called meta information objects are provided for annotation of the microarray data allowing integration of data from different sources, which is a feature that, for instance, is employed in the enhanced heatmap visualization.

abstract = {We have developed a methodology that allows integration of microarray data and meta information within a visualization in order to guide the investigator during data exploration and analysis. A simple mathematical framework is introduced that uses scoring functions to map meta information to relevance ratings of genes. To explore the potential of this framework we extended the traditional heatmap with new features to graphically represent the relevance ratings. These ratings are visualized by an additional color gradient, by scaling the vertical height of matrix rows, by rearranging rows or by inserting new columns into the heatmap. This visualization is called an enhanced heatmap. We have applied our approach to microarray data of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle, complemented with supplemental data that we both derived from the microarray data itself and retrieved from public databases. Using these data we demonstrate how this visualization concept can be efficiently used to identify certain features of genes and to detect inconsistencies in the data. Thus, the investigator has the possibility to get an overview of data from various sources and at the same time can gain a deeper insight into the structure of the combined data. The concept is not restricted to heatmaps, and can be used to extend further visualization techniques, such as profile plots. We found that our method is a powerful tool to integrate supplemental data into microarray visualizations and that it increases the efficiency of visual data exploration, which is a fundamental part of microarray data analyses.},

@article{Gratzl2013,
abstract = {Rankings are a popular and universal approach to structuring otherwise unorganized collections of items by computing a rank for each item based on the value of one or more of its attributes. This allows us, for example, to prioritize tasks or to evaluate the performance of products relative to each other. While the visualization of a ranking itself is straightforward, its interpretation is not, because the rank of an item represents only a summary of a potentially complicated relationship between its attributes and those of the other items. It is also common that alternative rankings exist which need to be compared and analyzed to gain insight into how multiple heterogeneous attributes affect the rankings. Advanced visual exploration tools are needed to make this process efficient. In this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of requirements for the visualization of multi-attribute rankings. Based on these considerations, we propose LineUp - a novel and scalable visualization technique that uses bar charts. This interactive technique supports the ranking of items based on multiple heterogeneous attributes with different scales and semantics. It enables users to interactively combine attributes and flexibly refine parameters to explore the effect of changes in the attribute combination. This process can be employed to derive actionable insights as to which attributes of an item need to be modified in order for its rank to change. Additionally, through integration of slope graphs, LineUp can also be used to compare multiple alternative rankings on the same set of items, for example, over time or across different attribute combinations. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-attribute visualization technique in a qualitative study. The study shows that users are able to successfully solve complex ranking tasks in a short period of time.},

abstract = {Prions cause transmissible neurodegenerative diseases and replicate by conformational conversion of normal benign forms of prion protein (PrPC) to disease-causing PrPSc isoforms. A systems approach to disease postulates that disease arises from perturbation of biological networks in the relevant organ. We tracked global gene expression in the brains of eight distinct mouse strain--prion strain combinations throughout the progression of the disease to capture the effects of prion strain, host genetics, and PrP concentration on disease incubation time. Subtractive analyses exploiting various aspects of prion biology and infection identified a core of 333 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that appeared central to prion disease. DEGs were mapped into functional pathways and networks reflecting defined neuropathological events and PrPSc replication and accumulation, enabling the identification of novel modules and modules that may be involved in genetic effects on incubation time and in prion strain specificity. Our systems analysis provides a comprehensive basis for developing models for prion replication and disease, and suggests some possible therapeutic approaches.},

@article{Schmidt:2008p1023,
abstract = {Mass spectrometry in combination with liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS) has emerged as the method of choice for the identification and quantification of protein sample mixtures. For very complex samples such as complete proteomes, the most commonly used LC-MS/MS method, data dependent (DDA) precursor selection, is of limited utility. The limited scan speed of current mass spectrometers, along with the highly redundant selection of the most intense precursor ions generate a bias in the pool of identified proteins towards those of higher abundance. A directed LC-MS/MS approach that alleviates the limitations of DDA precursor ion selection by decoupling peak detection and sequencing of selected precursor ions is presented. In the first stage of the strategy, all detectable peptide ion signals are extracted from high resolution LC-MS feature maps or aligned sets of feature maps. The selected features or a subset thereof are subsequently sequenced in sequential, non-redundant directed LC-MS/MS experiments and the MS/MS data are mapped back to the original LC-MS feature map in a fully automated manner. The strategy, implemented on a LTQ-FT MS platform, allowed the specific sequencing of 2,000 features per analysis and enabled the identification of more than 1,600 phosphorylation sites using a single reversed phase separation dimension without the need for time consuming pre-fraction steps. Compared to conventional DDA LC-MS/MS experiments, a substantially higher number of peptides could be identified from a sample and this increase was more pronounced for low intensity precursor ions.},
